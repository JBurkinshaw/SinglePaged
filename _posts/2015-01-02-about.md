# Do you wonder where to recycle your toaster, tires, or fluorescent bulbs?

#### Each April, at condos and apartments around Victoria, a small mountain of discarded furnishings appears in and beside dumpsters as people move out for the summer. There are a growing number of places to recycle these goods, but people are not always aware of where to take them. There are websites to tell you, but some people don’t know about them or use computers much. Bruce Mackenzie and Joe Burkinshaw decided to make a real wall map to show where to go. The result is right here on this site, and posted in a few laundry rooms around Victoria.

# Who pays for these maps?

#### Joe has done the development as a volunteer using free data and software, and Bruce is paying for the printing: $15-$25 each. The Capital Regional District recycling department likes these maps, but doesn’t have any budget to pay for them.

# Who distributes them?

#### So far, property managers at Proline Management have given them to a few condominium buildings. We’ll be talking to LandlordBC as well.
